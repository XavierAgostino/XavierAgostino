# 👋🏾 Hey, Xavier Agostino

Harvard CS student and former D1 football player. I build things when the existing tools do not solve the problem well.

Right now I am building Base Case, an AI native interview prep platform focused on infrastructure and production systems. Interviews are moving beyond algorithm puzzles and toward designing real world systems, especially AI powered infrastructure, but most prep platforms still focus on LeetCode style problems.

Most of my projects start the same way. I need something, it does not exist, or the options are weak, so I build it. The CFP simulator came from wanting a more objective playoff ranking system. AlgoPlatform came from struggling to find a solid graph visualizer while taking CS1240. Villa came from seeing how inefficient landlord tenant workflows are.

I think a lot about architecture and long term maintainability. Technical debt compounds quickly, and I would rather design for scale early than rewrite everything later.

Outside of code, I play chess.

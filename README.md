# 👋 Hey, I'm Xavier Agostino

CS student at Harvard, D1 football player, and I build things that solve real problems.

I'm into sports analytics, algorithm visualization, AI-powered apps, and data pipelines. Previously worked on rental property platforms and educational tools. When I'm not coding or on the field, I'm probably playing chess or binging soapy TV dramas.

## Stuff I've Built

**[CFP Selection Simulator](https://github.com/xavieragostino/cfp-selection-simulator)** - Objective College Football Playoff ranking system using ensemble methodology combining 5 mathematical algorithms (Colley Matrix, Massey, Elo, SOR, SOS). Processes 10,000+ FBS games with data caching that cuts API calls by 85%. Achieves 0.73 Spearman correlation against historical CFP committee selections. Built with Python, Docker, pandas, and Plotly.

**[AlgoPlatform](https://algo-platform.vercel.app)** - Educational platform for visualizing computer science algorithms. Built this when I couldn't find good tools to study graph algorithms. Interactive visualizers for Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford with step-by-step execution, real-time data structure updates, and full mobile support. Next.js, React, TypeScript.

**[Villa](https://rentwithvilla.com)** - Rental property management platform with AI-powered chat connecting landlords and tenants. OpenAI integration for intelligent Q&A, secure document management, and digital signatures. Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase.

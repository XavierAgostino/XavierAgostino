# 👋 Hey, I'm Xavier Agostino

CS student at Harvard, D1 football player, and I build things that combine sports and software.

I'm into AI-powered apps, sports analytics, algorithm visualizations, and anything tech-related. Previously worked on rental property management tools and educational software that actually makes sense.

When I'm not coding or on the field, I'm probably playing chess or binging some soapy TV Dramas.

## Stuff I've Built

**[CFP Selection Simulator](https://github.com/xavieragostino/cfp-selection-simulator)** - Data-driven College Football Playoff ranking system using 5 mathematical algorithms (Elo, Massey, Colley, SOR, SOS). Analyzes 752 games to generate objective playoff brackets. Built with Python, NumPy, pandas, and Plotly. 61% historical accuracy vs CFP committee selections.

**[Villa](https://rentwithvilla.com)** - Rental property management platform with AI chat for landlords and tenants. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase.

**[Shortest Path Visualizer](https://shortest-path-visualizer-pi.vercel.app)** - Made this to study for my Data Structures class. Visualizes Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms step-by-step.

**SquareTable** - Restaurant recommendation platform using PostgreSQL and Google OAuth. My CS50 final project.
